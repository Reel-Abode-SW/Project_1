Or color_rgb(num, num, num)

this should be plenty to get something started

simple farming simulator
text based. squares to represent crops
letter in center of square for type of crop
upper case = grown
lower case = growing
plants need to be watered
watering costs a small amount of money
other potential hazards, like crows (put a scarecrow near crops to keep them away)
can pay to increase field size, adding more squares
button in corner to advance to next day
