# Project_1

github is kinda weird

this should be plenty to get something started

simple farming simulator
text based. squares to represent crops
letter in center of square for type of crop
upper case = grown
lower case = growing
plants need to be watered
watering costs a small amount of money
other potential hazards, like crows (put a scarecrow near crops to keep them away)
can pay to increase field size, adding more squares
button in corner to advance to next day
